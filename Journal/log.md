# 100DaysOfCode
## Day 1 (01.01.23):
Happy new year! Today on TryHackMe I continued on the SOC analyst path and reviewed what I learned last week regarding the basics of threat modeling and network intrusion models.

I learned about MITRE and how it is a knowledge base that tracks Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and their tactics, techniques, and procedures. This helps understand how attacks occur which helps both mitigate and prevent attacks occuring in your environment.

I explored the Diamond Model and cyber kill chain as well which are other models to understand the different phases an attacker goes through to execute an attack from reconnaissance (gathering research on the target) to actions on objective. 

I also did some light review on Security+, specifically on the CIA triad and ways to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your data.

## Day 2 (01.02.23):
Day 2! I refined my notes on virtualization and set up an SSL certificate on AWS for my personal site, taeluralexis.com. I have little to no knowledge of AWS so I'm looking forward to hosting some projects on it! I also automated the process of setting up VMs using Vagrant. I'll most likely end the night with some more studying on the Security+.
